# AirBnB_clone

### Making a clone of the [airbnb.com](airbnb.com) application.

---

The aim of ths project is to create a clone of the Airbnb web application. Front-end clone as well as backend model clone.

---
#### Goals

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

---

### The console
- create your data model
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

For the backend interface of this application, you can interact with the application from the built python shell console.
##### *entry point* - ```console.py```

#### *run* - `./console.py` or `python3 console.py`

---
### Web static
- learn HTML/CSS
- create the HTML of your application
- create template of each object

---

### MySQL storage
- replace the file storage by a Database storage
- map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.
---

### Web framework - templating
- create your first web server in Python
- make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database
---

### RESTful API
- expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
- manipulate your objects via a RESTful API
---

### Web dynamic
- learn JQuery
- load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API
